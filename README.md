# 🧹 HR Data Cleaning Project

This project involves cleaning and preprocessing raw HR data to make it ready for analysis and machine learning tasks. It demonstrates core data preparation techniques such as handling missing values, type conversions, feature transformation, and outlier detection.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The dataset contains employee information like age, salary, job role, and experience. However, it's messy and contains:

- Missing values
- Inconsistent formatting
- Irrelevant or duplicate records
- Numeric and categorical anomalies

The goal is to build a reproducible data cleaning pipeline that prepares this data for accurate and insightful analysis.

## 🛠️ What This Project Covers

- Handling Missing Values (Imputation or Removal)
- Removing Duplicates
- Converting Data Types
- Standardizing and Normalizing Numerical Features (like Age, Salary)
- Encoding Categorical Variables
